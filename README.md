Signal peptides (SPs) are short amino acid sequences in the N-terminal region of many newly synthesized proteins that are directed toward the cell secretory pathway(ER-Golgi-Membrane-Extracellular). In this project Von Heijne and Support Vector Machine methods were used to detect the presence of SPs. So the main goal is to compare these two approaches to address SPs biological problem.
